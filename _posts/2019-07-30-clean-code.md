A very brief and general introduction to clean code by Cory House. Applicable to all languages. Touch on topics such as naming, conditionals, functions, classes, and comments.

The main takeaway from this course:

This pyramid provides a path for everyone to establish a strong foundation in software development.

## Naming

- Classes should indicate their responsibility.
- Methods should reflect their action / purpose.
  - if a name contains conjunction, you are likely violating Single Responsibility principle, and you should refactor.
- Avoid abbreviations.

## Conditionals

- Use positive boolean, instead of naming variables as "isNotTrue".
- Avoid "Stringly Typed" conditions. Use Enum to hold string values.
- Replace explicit boolean comparison with method calls that returns boolean.
- Use polymorphism to replace conditionals.
- Use table records (in DB or some storage) to determine condition.

## Functions

- Create functions to reuse code and avoid duplication.
  - a good sign is either spotting the exact same code block or similar code structure.
- Extract long methods into small functions of single responsibilities.
- Return early and fail fast.
  - Do validations and requirements checking upfront, before executing the core logic of the function.
  - This prevents the software from entering a corrupted state, and makes code easier to read.
- Avoid loose / short-lived local variables. Replace them with method calls.
- Use exceptions to catch problems.

## Classes

- Used to group attributes and methods of the same responsibility together.
- Should not have too much knowledge of other classes. 
  - Use inversion of control pattern to deal with such scenarios.

## Comments

- With proper naming and clean coding, comments are unnecessary most of the time.
- May be used to document design decisions, trade-offs, and design intent.
- Avoid apologies and warnings.
- Avoid commenting out codes, which becomes zombie codes.
- Avoid formatting characters, as they are nice to view but hard to maintain.
- Avoid tagging issue numbers, ticket numbers using comments, as that can already be handled with commit messages / branches using source control.

## Final Reminders

- If not broken, why fix?
- If broken, please fix. (avoid the Broken Windows Theory, which essentially means technical debt).
- Practice code reviews and pair programming.
- Follow boy scout rule (leave the code a little better than when you received it).
