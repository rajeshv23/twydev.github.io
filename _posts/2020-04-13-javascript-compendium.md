# A Brief History of JavaScript

The best place to get started would be [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript). Here are the important milestones extracted from this wiki page:

- **1995**: Netscape Navigator, the only browser in the market, was shipped with LiveScript and the interpreter. It was later re-branded as JavaScript to be associated with the then popular Java language.
- **1996**: Microsoft released JScript, along with Internet Explorer. Difference between the two scripting languages caused long lasting incompatibility, with certain websites only supporting one browser or the other.
- 1996: Netscape submitted JavaScript to ECMA in an attempt to standardize specification
- **2005**: Debut of Ajax, a set of technologies using JavaScript to allow web applications to load data in the background. Sparked a renaissance period of JavaScript, leading to creation of popular libraries like jQuery and Prototype.
- **2008**: Google Chrome shipped with V8 engine, the first to use just-in-time compilation, significantly improving JS execution time.
- **2009**: Multiple browser vendors came together to help build the ES5 standard.
- **2015**: Release of ES6, renamed ECMAScript 2015.
- **Beyond**: From 2016 onwards, a new version of ECMAScript standard was published with minor updates to existing standard. JS is now considered a mature language.

# How Browsers Work

Since the invention of JavaScript was solely driven by the desire to enrich web browsing experience through client side processing, we must have at least a basic understanding of how modern browsers work. Here is a link to an [article written by Tali Garsiel](http://taligarsiel.com/Projects/howbrowserswork1.htm) that explores the internals of web browsers. The article is old, but gold.
