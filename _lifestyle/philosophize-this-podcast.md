Highly entertaining and educational podcast. Please support the original [content creator](https://www.philosophizethis.org/).

## What I like about this series

Instead of studying philosophy by purely looking at the ideas, this podcast provides historical context and anecdotal examples to bring out the significance of those ideas.

## Why is philosophy interesting and significant

- **It is intuitive**: Everyone has thought about the question of existence. Philosophy is a collection of what others have thought about this same topic so that we can learn from it to form our thoughts. Just like Quora.
- **It is our history**: All our knowledge is built upon the works of great thinkers before us. Philosophy helps us to better appreciate our history and help puts the various fields we are pursuing today into perspective.
- **It is how we think**: People in the past are no more foolish than us. We simply have easier access to information. Studying how philosophy evolved provides insights into how people think, and may inspire our next innovative ideas. I feel that philosophy, history, psychology, and economics are disciplines from the same branch of knowledge.
- **It is not religion**: Unfortunately, I have not found any religion that made me feel comfortable, and I cannot believe in something without a doubt. Philosophy is an alternative avenue to seek inner peace.

## My notes from episode 1

- Metaphysics - the study of reality and nature.
- Epistemology - the study of knowledge.

- Early western philosophies:
  - Pre-socratic
  - Socrates, Plato, Aristotle
  - Post-Aristotle to Medieval

[Thales of Miletus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thales_of_Miletus)

- Rich, good looking guy. Feels like a savant.
- Defy the conventional wisdom of his time (a natural phenomenon explained through gods and deities, by the [authoritative text](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theogony) of his time) to predict a good harvest using his observations of the climate and profit from it.
- Doing it to prove a point. Probably viewed as an outsider by people of his time for his radical thinking.
- Thinks that water is the fundamental element of all existence, due to the various physical states and fluid behavior that water exhibits.
- Taught philosophy. Started the Milesian school of thought. The OG of philosophy.

[Anaximander](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anaximander)

- Bright student from Milesian school.
- Concluded that the first human must have grown and developed before being born, from the belly of a fish. (This is not related to evolution).
- Helped to propagate philosophy.
- Teacher of [Anaximenes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anaximenes_of_Miletus). They form the three crown jewels of the Milesian school. The two students adding more sophistication on top of the revolutionary ideas of Thales.

[Heraclitus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heraclitus)

- Opposite of the Milesian. Grumpy, anti-social old man. Known as the "riddler" who wrote paradoxical riddles.
- Nothing but contempt for everyone around him who don't understand his understanding of nature, even for people who praise him (the Persian king who is fascinated by him and invited him to his castle).
- Plays dice/gamble every day. Refuse to use his knowledge and wisdom to better public service.
- Thinks that people around him are not "woke". Didn't trust doctors, eventually died of a disease when he tried to cure himself.
- Didn't think that nature is made up of a fundamental substance. But rather the world is governed by some divine "logos".
- Everything is in a permanent state of flux, opposites battling with each other in harmony.
- Famous quote "you cannot step into the same river twice".

[Democritus and Leucippus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democritus)

- Crowning achievement of all pre-socratic thinkers.
- His idea that things are made up of atom and void was way ahead of his time but was denounced until a resurgence due to science.
- Completely mechanistic view of the world. No concept of the afterlife. Presented in [famous poem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_rerum_natura).
- Atomic theory was inspired by:
  - dust particles suspended in the air and think of non-visible particles making up everything.
  - trying to solve the [dichotomy paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeno%27s_paradoxes). Eventually, something non-divisible must exist to solve the paradox. (the root of asymptotic thinking).
  - something cannot come from nothing. Changes are simply re-configuration of atoms. Like, attract like (based on natural observations), so similar atoms attract and form objects. Atoms cannot be cut, cannot be destroyed, and are therefore eternal.
- Influenced by Pythagoreans and Parmenides.
- Used atoms to explain all phenomena. Different types of atoms create the attributes of the larger objects.
- True-born knowledge, derived through reasons, is superior to senses-based knowledge, which can be deceived.

## Takeaways

- Pre-socratic metaphysical thinking tends towards [monism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monism).
- Heraclitus' idea is pretty similar to Taoism's thinking of opposites giving significance to each other. Observations of nature tend towards similar conclusions because we are limited by what we may perceive with our senses.
- Pre-socratic is a one-size-fits-all approach to explaining the world. This is human nature. (e.g. we see someone who only knows how to build a PHP server use it to solve all problems, regardless of whether it is appropriate, as long as it works.)
- These philosophers are significant not because they are right (in fact they are all wrong), but because their ideas help to propel our thinking and knowledge forward.
- Would be interesting to find out if there is any common behavior or personality among them e.g. clearly Thales and Heraclitus are oddballs. Perhaps they all think that they are above their peers and everyone else is not "woke". What do they think about morality and do they have compassion?
