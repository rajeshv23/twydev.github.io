When creating new blog posts take note of the following.

- Only the first 50 words in content body will be included in search!
- The current home page uses default `layout: home` which inherits from theme, unless overwritten.
- Test the site locally, run `bundle exec jekyll serve`
- for help, go to [theme documentation](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/quick-start-guide/)
- for further reading on Jekyll visit [official site](https://jekyllrb.com/)

Todo List:

- Move images to CDN
- Grammarly integration
- blog consolidation and migration from other platforms
